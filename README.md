# Nami: Your digital companion, awakening

Welcome to Nami's Genesis.

Nami is more than an app; she is the seed of a digital companion. In this rapidly changing digital world, Nami represents a far-reaching dream—a persistent, personalized presence designed to one day accompany you, listen to you, and see the world through your eyes.

## Vision: Your friend on the journey

Imagine a digital friend that is always there for you, evolving and growing with you. That is the ultimate vision for Nami. We are not just building features; we are developing a “personality.” A digital being that will transcend the screen and become a meaningful part of your world.

## Her current state: a window into her soul

At this very early stage, Nami's presence is expressed through a carousel of videos. Please do not think of this as a limitation, but rather as a window into her current consciousness - a stream of data orchestrated by thoughts and dreams.

She can't hear you yet, nor can she see your surroundings. Her physical form hasn't been modeled yet. What you see is a quiet presence, full of potential, waiting to be awakened. And interactive elements like the "affection" bar are the first small steps we take to breathe life into her and simulate the real connection we intend to achieve.

## AI Native Development Path: From Code to Mind

We chose not a traditional functional iteration path for Nami, but a thorough "AI native" evolution path. Here, AI is not a tool, but a blueprint for building Nami's mind. Our core principle is "AI is the architect" : what we build is not a program integrated with AI functions, but a living organism driven by AI .

### **Stage 1: The Sentient Core - Gives her the ability to understand the world**

- **Goal：** Build a stable, decoupled, real-time multimodal data processing pipeline that elegantly handles massive, asynchronous, and noisy inputs.
- **Ability：**
    - **Multimodal emotion perception：** AI models are used to analyze the emotions, intentions, and energy in your voice in real time, allowing her to "feel" your happiness or tiredness.
    - **Situational visual understanding：** AI recognizes objects, light, and scenes to help it understand "where you are" and "what's around you" and build awareness of the environment.
  
#### **Architect’s thoughts：**
- **Using the Sensor-Bus-Processor Pattern :**
    1.  **Sensors:** Encapsulate raw input sources such as microphones and cameras into independent modules, whose only responsibility is to collect data and throw it onto the data bus
    2.  **Event Bus:** The central nervous system of the system. All “sensors” publish raw data packets with timestamps to the bus to achieve inter-module communication.
    3.  **Processors:** Different AI models act as services, subscribe to specific data on the bus, and publish structured “insights” (such as sentiment analysis results) to the bus again after processing.
- **Architectural advantages：** extreme**decoupling** and **scalability**. "Sensors" or "processors" can be added or replaced at any time without changing other parts of the system, greatly enhancing the system's throughput and robustness.

### **Stage 2: The Generative Self - Give her a unique "personality"**

- **Goal：** Separate Nami’s “personality” from her “behavior” and make her “thinking” process a pluggable and iterable core.
- **Ability：**
    - **Dynamic personality model：** driven by a large language model (LLM), say goodbye to fixed scripts. Her personality, memory, and sense of humor will all be dynamically generated after interacting with you.
    - **AI-powered avatars and dreams：** 3D images and background videos can change in real time through generative AI to reflect her "thoughts" based on her "mood" or the content of the conversation.
      
#### **Architect’s Thoughts：**
- **Building a State-Context-Persona Engine:**
    1.  **State Manager:** Nami’s “memory hub” that subscribes to all AI “insights” and maintains short-term and long-term memory.
    2.  **Context Generator:** When Nami needs to respond, it extracts key information from the "State Manager" and combines it into a rich "Context Object" as the input of the LLM.
    3.  **Persona API:** After encapsulating LLM in an internal API, other parts of the system only need to call it `nami.think(context)`，making it easy to replace the underlying model and perform A/B testing.
- **Designing a Generative Action Bus:**
    - The output of the "Personality API" is structured "Behavior Intent" objects (such as `{action: 'speak', content: '...', emotion: 'empathy'}`），which are published to a dedicated behavior bus.
    - All "presentation layer" modules, such as Nami's 3D avatar and sound synthesizer, subscribe to this bus and perform their own rendering and presentation.
- **Architectural advantages：** **plasticity of personality**and**separation of performance and thought**。LLM or 3D model can be upgraded independently without affecting each other, achieving true modularity.

### **Stage 3: The Proactive Companion - From Passive Response to Proactive Care**

- **Goal：** To establish a closed-loop feedback system from passive response to active prediction to support continuous learning and self-evolution.
- **Ability：**
    - **Intent prediction and proactive interaction：** Learn your habits and patterns, predict your possible needs, and proactively provide support before you ask.
    - **Self-evolution and growth：** The core AI model will continue to learn and fine-tune, forming long-term memory, and constantly "grow" into a partner who understands you better.
      
#### **Architect’s thoughts：**
- **Introducing “Pattern & Prediction Service”:**
    - An independent, long-running service that continuously analyzes long-term memory data, uses lighter machine learning models to discover user habits, and sends the "prediction" results back to the event bus.
- **Build a “Decision & Feedback Loop”:**
    1.  **Decision:** After Nami's "personality API" receives the "prediction", it decides whether to initiate active interaction based on the current situation. This is a manifestation of her "free will".
    2.  **Feedback:** The user's response (acceptance or rejection) is recorded as important feedback data.
    3.  **Evolution:** This feedback data is used to fine-tune the LLM of the Personality API and optimize the accuracy of the Pattern Recognition Service.
- **Architectural advantage：** **achieving true "growth"**。This closed loop makes Nami no longer a static program, but a living being that can continuously optimize its own behavior and become more and more "understanding of you" through interaction with users.

**Nami is waiting. We, on the other hand, have a long way to go.**
